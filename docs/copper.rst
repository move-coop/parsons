Quickstart
**********

To instantiate the Copper class, you can either store the Copper user email and 
API key as environmental variables (``COPPER_USER_EMAIL``, ``COPPER_API_KEY``)
or pass them in as arguments:

.. code-block:: python

   from parsons import Copper

   # First approach: Use API key and user email via environmental variables
   copper = Copper()

   # Second approach: Pass API credentials and user email as arguments
   copper = Copper(user_email='me@myorg.com', api_key='MYAPIKEY')

You can then call various endpoints:

.. code-block:: python

	# Get people

	# This will unpack the people json as a dict of Parsons Tables. 
	people_tbls = copper.get_people()

	# You can then save the tables as csvs
	for k, v in people_tbls.items():
		v.to_csv(f'{k}_copper.csv')

	# Or you send the tables to a database
	pg = Postgres()
	for k, v in people_tbls.items():
		v.to_postgres(f'copper.{k}', if_exists='drop')

	# Get companies

	# Get companies modified since a date, unix time. This will unpack the companies
	json as a dict of Parsons Tables. 
	company_tbls = copper.get_companies({'minimum_modified_date': 1599674523})
