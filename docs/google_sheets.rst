GoogleSheets

********
Overview
********

The GoogleSheets class allows you to interact with a Google Drive spreadsheet.

In order to instantiate the class, you must pass Google Drive credentials as a dictionary, or store the credentials as a JSON string in the ``GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable. Typically you'll get the credentials from the Google Developer Console (look for the "Google Drive API").
