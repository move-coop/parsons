To instantiate the ``Phone2Action`` class, you can either pass in the app ID and app key as arguments or set the
``PHONE2ACTION_APP_ID`` and ``PHONE2ACTION_APP_KEY`` environmental variables.

.. code-block:: python

   from parsons import Phone2Action

   # Instantiate the class using environment variables
   p2a = Phone2Action()

   # Get all advocates updated in the last day
   import datetime
   today = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
   yesterday = today - datetime.timedelta(days=1)

   # get_advocates returns a dictionary that maps the advocate data (e.g. phones) to a parsons
   # Table with the data for each advocate
   advocates_data = p2a.get_advocates(updated_since=yesterday)

   # For all of our advocates' phone numbers, opt them into SMS
   for phone in advocates_data['phones']:
       phone_number = phone['phones_address']
       # Only update phone numbers that aren't already subscribed
       if phone['subscribed']:
           p2a.update_advocate(phone['advocate_id'], phone=phone_number, sms_opt_in=True)
