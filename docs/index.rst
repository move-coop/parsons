About
=====

Parsons, named after `Lucy Parsons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Parsons>`_, is a Python package that contains a growing list of connectors and integrations to move data between various tools. Parsons is focused on integrations and connectors for tools utilized by the progressive community.

Parsons was built out of a belief that progressive organizations spend far too much time building the same integrations, over and over and over again, while they should be engaged in more important and impactful work. It
was built and is maintained by The Movement Cooperative.

The Movement Cooperative
========================
The Movement Cooperative is a member led organization focused on providing data, tools and strategic support for the progressive community. Our mission is to break down technological barriers for organizations that fight for social justice.

Installation
============

You can install Parsons using ``pip install parsons``. We recommend using a `virtual environment <https://www.parsonsproject.org/pub/installation#setting-up-your-virtual-environment>`_.

Need more detail? We have a `detailed, beginner-friendly guide to installing Parsons <https://www.parsonsproject.org/pub/installation/>`_ on our website.

We also have a Parsons Docker container hosted on `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/movementcooperative/parsons>`_ for each release of Parsons.

QuickStart
==========


.. code-block:: python

  # VAN - Download activist codes to a CSV

  from parsons import VAN
  van = VAN(db='MyVoters')
  ac = van.get_activist_codes()
  ac.to_csv('my_activist_codes.csv')

  # Redshift - Create a table from a CSV

  from parsons import Table
  tbl = Table.from_csv('my_table.csv')
  tbl.to_redshift('my_schema.my_table')

  # Redshift - Export from a query to CSV

  from parsons import Redshift
  sql = 'select * from my_schema.my_table'
  rs = Redshift()
  tbl = rs.query(sql)
  tbl.to_csv('my_table.csv')

  # Upload a file to S3

  from parsons import S3
  s3 = S3()
  s3.put_file('my_bucket','my_table.csv')

  # TargetSmart - Append data to a record

  from parsons import TargetSmart
  ts = TargetSmart(api_key='MY_KEY')
  record = ts.data_enhance(231231231, state='DC')

Design Goals
============
The goal of Parsons is to make the movement of data between systems as easy and straightforward as possible. Simply put, we seek to reduce the lines of code that are written by the progressive community. Not only is this a waste of time, but we rarely have the capacity and resources to fully unittest our scripts.

.. image:: /_static/parsons_diagram.png

Parsons seeks to be flexible from a data ingestion and output perspective, while providing ETL tools that recognize that our data is **always** messy. Central to this concept is the :ref:`parsons-table` the table-like object that most methods return.

Logging
=======
Parsons uses the `native python logging system <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html>`_. By default, log output will go to the console and look like:

.. code-block:: none

    parsons.modulename LOGLEVEL the specific log message

In your scripts that use Parsons, if you want to override the default Parsons logging behavior, just grab the "parsons" logger and tweak it:

.. code-block:: python

   import logging
   parsons_logger = logging.getLogger('parsons')
   # parsons_logger.setLevel('DEBUG')
   # parsons_logger.addHandler(...)
   # parsons_logger.setFormatter(...)

Integrating Parsons
===================

A primary goal of Parsons is to make installing and use as easy as possible. Many of the patterns
and examples that we document are meant to show how easy it can be to use Parsons, but sometimes
these patterns trade immediate accessibility against ease of integration.

In environments where Parsons is not the primary application, or in scenarios where Parsons must
run with limited resources, we recommend users install only the dependencies they need at loose
version constraints. To do this, simply set two environment variables before installing Parsons
and keep one while running:

```
export PIP_NO_BINARY=parsons
export PARSONS_LIMITED_DEPENDENCIES=true
pip install parsons
```

```
export PARSONS_LIMITED_DEPENDENCIES=true
python myparsons_script.py
```

`PIP_NO_BINARY` tells pip to use the source distribution of Parsons, which then allows
`PARSONS_LIMITED_DEPENDENCIES` to dynamically limit to the bare minimum dependencies needed to
run Parsons.  Users may also install extra dependencies appropriate to their environment, e.g.

```
export PIP_NO_BINARY=parsons
export PARSONS_LIMITED_DEPENDENCIES=true
pip install parsons[google]
```

or

```
export PIP_NO_BINARY=parsons
export PARSONS_LIMITED_DEPENDENCIES=true
pip install parsons[google,ngpvan]
```


*** Don't import from the root Parsons package ***

Throughout the Parsons documentation, users are encouraged to load Parsons classes like so:

.. code-block:: python

   from parsons import Table

In order to support this pattern, Parsons imports all of its classes into the root `parsons`
package. Due to how Python loads modules and packages, importing even one Parsons class results
in ALL of them being loaded. The `PARSONS_LIMITED_DEPENDENCIES` variable tells Parsons to skip
this; it will not import all of its classes into the root `parsons` package. Setting this
environment variable means you will **NOT** be able to import using the `from parsons import X`
pattern. Instead, you will need to import directly from the package where a class is defined
(e.g. `from parsons.etl import Table`). Using this method, you may see as much as an 8x
decrease in memory usage for Parsons!
