Overview

`MobileCommons <https://secure.mcommons.com/>`_ is a broadcast text messaging tool that helps orgranizations
mobilize supporters and fundraise by building opt-ed in audiences. You can read more about the product
`here <https://uplandsoftware.com/mobile-messaging/>`_.

***********
Quick Start
***********

To instantiate a class you must pass the username and password of a MobileCommons account as an argument
or store the username and password into environmental variables called ``MOBILECOMMONS_USERNAME`` and
``MOBILECOMMONS_PASSWORD``, respectively. If you MobileCommons account has access to various MobileCommons
companies (i.e. organizations), you'll need to specify which MobileCommons company you'd like to interact
with by specifying the Company ID in the ``company_id`` parameter. To find the Company ID, navigate to the
`Company and Users page <https://secure.mcommons.com/companies/>`_.

.. code-block:: python
   from parsons import MobileCommons

   # Pass credentials via environmental variables for account has access to only one MobileCommons company
   mc = MobileCommons()

    # Pass credentials via environmental variables for account has access to multiple MobileCommons companies
    mc = MobileCommons(company_id='EXAMPLE78363BOCA483954419EB70986A68888')

    # Pass credentials via argument for account has access to only one MobileCommons company
    mc = MobileCommons(username='octavia.b@scifi.net', password='badpassword123')

Then you can call various endpoints:

.. code-block:: python
    # Return all MobileCommons subscribers in a table
    subscribers = get_campaign_subscribers(campaign_id=1234567)

    # Create a new profile, return profile_id
    new_profile=create_profile(phone=3073991987, first_name='Jane', last_name='Fonda')
