Quickstart
==========

In order to instantiate the Quickbooks Time class, you need to pass in your Quickbooks Time API token
as an environment variable "QB_AUTH_TOKEN" or pass it in as a parameter called token="your_token".

**Example 1**

.. code-block:: python

  from parsons import QuickBooksTime

  # instantiate the quickbooks class
  qb = QuickBooksTime(token="your_token") 

  #Timesheets Table
  timesheets_tbl = qb.get_timesheets()

This example shows how to get timesheets for a given date range.
