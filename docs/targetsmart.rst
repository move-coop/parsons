.. note::
  **TargetSmart Developer API versus Automation**

    Unless TargetSmart has provided a custom workflow solution for you, you can
    ignore the Automation information.

    TargetSmart's Developer API provides an HTTP-based interface for consuming the
    general web services that TargetSmart provides. The TargetSmart Automation
    system solely provides a solution for consuming customized file processing
    workflows that are provisioned for specific client needs. TargetSmart Automation
    is based on SFTP instead of HTTP.
