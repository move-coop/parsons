TargetSmart Automation Workflows
================================

In addition to the :doc:`TargetSmart Developer API <../targetsmart_api>`,
TargetSmart also provides a solution for executing custom data processing
workflows that TargetSmart implements for specific client needs. The
``TargetSmartAutomation`` class can be used to execute these workflows for
common purposes such as customized list matching workflows. Workflow execution
can take minutes to hours depending on the workflow type, size of data, and
queuing.

.. note::
  Authentication
    TargetSmart Automation workflows use SFTP. You will need to obtain SFTP credentials from TargetSmart to utilize the ``TargetSmartAutomation`` class.

Quickstart
==========

To instantiate ``TargetSmartAutomation``, you can either store your SFTP username and password
as the environmental variables ``TS_SFTP_USERNAME`` and ``TS_SFTP_PASSWORD``, or pass them in as
keyword arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    from parsons import TargetSmartAutomation

    # First approach: Store SFTP username and password as environmental variables
    ts_auto = TargetSmartAutomation()

    # Second approach: Pass SFTP username and password as arguments. These are
    # provided by TargetSmart for your account. Warning: Do not store password
    # literals in your source code.
    ts_auto = TargetSmartAutomation(
        sftp_username='my_sftp_username', sftp_password='my_sftp_password'
    )


You can then call these methods:

.. code-block:: python

    # Execute a custom workflow that TargetSmart has provisioned for you. This
    # blocks until completion and may take minutes/hours depending on the data size
    # and workflow type

    input_table = Table.from_csv('my_file_to_match.csv')
    output_table = ts_auto.match(
        input_table,
        'workflow_name_provided_by_targetsmart',
        'my_job_name',
        emails=['bob@example.com'],
    )

    # Most Automation workflows perform list matching, but not all. The ``execute``
    # method is an alias for the ``match`` method to avoid confusion in these cases.
    # This is the equivalent to the above
    output_table = ts_auto.execute(
        input_table,
        'workflow_name_provided_by_targetsmart',
        'my_job_name',
        emails=['bob@example.com'],
    )

    # Optionally check the status of a workflow execution
    ts_auto.match_status(job_name='my_job_name')

    # Optionally remove all files for the match job. TargetSmart's lifecycle rules
    # will remove eventually if not.
    ts_auto.remove_files(job_name='my_job_name')
