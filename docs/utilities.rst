Cloud Storage
=============
The Parsons cloud storage utility was created to interact with APIs that require access to files
to run an asynchronous process. 

The cloud storage utility is currently being utilitized primarily by the NGPVAN class
methods such as :func:`~parsons.ngpvan.van.Scores.upload_scores` and 
:func:`~parsons.ngpvan.van.SavedLists.upload_saved_list`.

These methods have arguments specific their method, but all also contain the following cloud 
storage arguments:

* ``url_type`` - The type of cloud storage to utilize. Currently ``S3`` or ``GCS``.

* ``**url_kwargs`` - These are arguments specific to the cloud storage type in order to initialize. They
  are listed below based on the url type.

The file will then be converted to a CSV, compressed and posted to the cloud storage. A presigned url will
be generated and active by default for 60 minutes, but you can adjust the time.
