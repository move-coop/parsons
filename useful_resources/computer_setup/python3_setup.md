# Installing Python 3


## Why Python 3?

As you may have heard, starting [January 1, 2020][countdown] [Python 2.x is no
longer officially supported][eol_article].

Additionally, [Parsons][parsons] is only compatible with Python 3. So, in order to
use parsons, you need to have Python 3 installed.


## Getting Started

There are a number of ways to [install Python 3][install_py3]. Before you
install it, check what version, if any, you already have installed on your computer.

### Check Python Version

1. Open the **Terminal** app
2. Type `python --version`
   * If you see something like `Python 3.x.x` then you are all set.
    If not got to step 3
3. Type `python3 --version`
   * If you don't see any output then you need to install python 3.

## Testing Code Locally

There a many ways to run code locally to make sure it works before submitting
it for review. For folks who are new to Python, we recommend using [Jupyter
Notebooks][jupyter] as it allows you to run blocks of code individually and to see
instant outputs.
