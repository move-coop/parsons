config_vars = {
    # Connector 1:
    "ACTBLUE_CLIENT_UUID": "",  # see https://secure.actblue.com/docs/csv_api#authentication
    "ACTBLUE_CLIENT_SECRET": "",  # see https://secure.actblue.com/docs/csv_api#authentication

# Code

# Step 1: Specify name and permissions for the new Google Sheet
# A new spreadsheet with this name will be created, even if another spreadsheet with this name
# already exists. The Google Sheets connector will create the new spreadsheet, with 0 rows, and
# then overwrite the empty spreadsheet with your data. This script will not overwrite or update
# existing Google Sheets.
spreadsheet_name = "Contributions - January"

# This script will create a Google Sheet with Restriced permissions -- only people specifically
# added can open it. The account specifed in the Google credentials file will be the owner of
# the new spreadsheet. If you created a Service Account, the Service Account will be the owner.
# In this case, to receive a link to the spreadsheet and editor permissions, you must provide
# your email address. Once the sheet has been created you may add user permissions in Google Sheets.
editor_email = ""

#         created the credential for, during the specified date range
#     'refunded_contributions':
#         contributions to your entity that were refunded, during the specified date range
#     'managed_form_contributions':
#         contributions made through any form that is managed by your entity, during the specified
#         date range - including contributions to other entities via that form if it is a tandem
#         form.

# Step 3: Retrieve data from ActBlue and hold it in a Parsons Table.
