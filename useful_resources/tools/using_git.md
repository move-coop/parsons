# Using Git


## What is Git?

Git is a tool for versioning and version control. In other words, you can track
changes over time for files in a project. Git works by saving snapshots of your
project after changes are "committed".

**Note:** Not to be confused with GitHub which is a vendor for hosting code.


## Basic Usage

To check that you have git install type `git --version` into your terminal. To
run git commands, the command must be preceded by `git`. See the
examples below.

| Command | Description | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `init` | Initialize git in the current folder. | `git init` |
| `clone` | Copy the code from a remote host and initialize git. | `git clone https://github.com/move-coop/parsons.git` |
| `pull` | Get all the changes from the remote host. | `git pull` |
| `branch` | List all the branches. | `git branch` |
| `checkout` | Start working on a specific branch. Adding the `-b` creates the branch. | `git checkout master` or `git checkout -d new-branch` |
| `status` | See what files youâ€™re tracking/not tracking, have been modified and or are ready to commit. | `git status` |
| `add` | Add a file as ready to be committed aka stage a file. | `git add modified_file.txt` |
| `commit` | Save all the changes that have been added (staged). If you exclude `-m` and the message, your default terminal editor opens up for you to add a message. | `git commit -m "My commit message"` |
| `push` | Send the changes and change history to the remote host. | `git push` |


## Sample Workflow

**Prerequisite:** A project that has been initialized with git and has a remote
host.

1. Get any changes from the remote host. `git pull`
2. Switch to the branch you're working on. `git checkout my-branch`
3. Make and save changes (as many time as necessary).
  1. Make a change.
  2. Stage the file. `git add modified_file.txt`
  3. Commit the changes. `git commit -m "Made changes."`
4. Push your changes to the remote host. `git push`
5. Change back to the master branch. `git checkout master`


## Tips

* Before starting to work, remember to `git pull` to get any changes made from
the remote host.
* When switching to other work, remember to `git commit` and `git push` your
changes.
